Graduate Attributes Summary
This spreadsheet is intended to be used in conjunction with the ICDT to summarize graduate attributes collection across an entire program each year.
Currently, it requires manual manipulation of the data as follows:
1. Cut-and-paste the ICDT summary page for each course where graduate attributes collection occurred in the "Course-x" worksheets.
   (a) when pasting, use Edit > Paste Special, then select "values"
   (b) ensure that the "Instruction Level" fields have been entered.
   (c) currently, the graduate attributes are reported as an average of the individual assessments
2. Once all of the individual course summaries have been entered, they are automatically summarized in the "Summary" and the "Data" worksheets.
   (a) Summary - please do not change this worksheet; it lists all graduate attributes results from the course summaries
   (b) Data - this worksheet is a duplicate of the "Summary" that is used to sort the data for presentation
3. The "Data" worksheet can be used to prepare the data for presentation in a graphical format
   (a) Sort entire table on "Instruction List" (column E) Z-A
   (b) Sort populated table on "R" (column B) smallest-to-largest
   (c) Plot as column chart (potentially more than one)
   (d) Selected the data for plotting ("column" appears to work well for this)
The longer term plan is to automate this process.
